Graphs may be found attached to the end of this script. The Y-axis uses a logarithmic scale, and as such error bars are too small to be useful, so have been omitted. Performance tests were run under the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Within \texttt{db/dim.h}, the page size was set to 8KB, the number of pages was 300,000, and the size of the buffer pool (in number of pages) was 1,000.
  \item The binary was built using \texttt{g++} version 5.3.0 with \texttt{-O2} set.
  \item The benchmarks were run on a machine running OS X 10.11.3, running a 2.8GHz Core i7 (2 cores), with 16GB of RAM. (Perhaps the only relevant metric here is the single core frequency, as the benchmarks were single-threaded and used only 8MB of RAM).
  \item The benchmarks were run 5 times, and the mean time taken was calculated.
\end{itemize}
